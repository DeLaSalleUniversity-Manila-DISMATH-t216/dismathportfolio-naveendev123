# WEEK 1
 -On the first week, i was introduced to the course DISMATH which is basically more on logic than it is math, despite having math in the name.
 
 -I learned some basic terms that are going to be used in the course such as PROOF which is a chain of logical deductions leading to the proposition from a base set of axioms.

 -LOGICAL DEDUCTION is a process of reasoning.
 
 -AXIOMS are statements or propositions that are regarded to be true.

 -I was refreshed on one of my high school lessons on the AND OR gates but this time i also learned what they were called and what symbols are used to represent them. Such as AND was conjunction and OR was Disjunction.

 -I also learned new operators that were not discussed in high school such as the biconditional and conditionals.
 
 -I learned about the different kinds of prook such as; Legal truth, Authoritative truth and scientific truth etc.
# WEEK 2
 -This week, the most important thing i learned was the Logical Equivalences or the laws on logical proofs, like the De Morgan's Law and Absorption laws and etc,
 
 -I learned how the english sentence structures have effects on how you will prove a statement like the Predicate logic which puts in consideration which is the subject and which is the predicate in the sentence.
 
 -Im still a bit confused with Existential quantifiers but i know how to apply it, and I learned stuff like Universal Quantifiers.
 
 -I also learned when unversal and existential quantifiers are always true or false.
 
 -Lastly for WEEK 2, I learned about the Rules of inference which are pretty useful when proving statements; some are easy to use and are very basic but others like the Modus ponens and the syllogisms might take some time to get used to using.
# WEEK 3
 -This week, I learned the different methods of proof like the DIrect proof, Vacuos proof and trivial proof and the like.
 
 -Im still a bit confused with most of the methods of proof but Direct proof and proof by Contraposition is pretty easy.
# WEEK 4
 -This week, we refreshed our ENGALG2 lesson on mathematical induction.
 
 -I learned that mathematical induction was actually just proving.
 
 -I learned that you should never miss the basis step which is the first step because it could look true be proven false at the first step but true on the second step.
